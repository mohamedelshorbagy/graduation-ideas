# Snippets with Containers

- My Idea about making a snippets that can be compiled directly in the website and give the user a good information about the compilation process(time , ...etc) with the help of containers(dockers or vagrant) and if the code needs a gui interface we open a virtual machine and take some screen shoots and bring it back to user 
- Make an ML/AI Model that can understand the code and suggest a better way to write it and optimize it
- Make a ranking and recommendation system with the whole system to help use get the best experience with our app 
- Try to make something helpful to other developers in the industry and help them make reliable code and systems with the help of out snippets
