# Version Control For Designers

- This idea inspired by our friends in the Design Industry who have to name their fiels to repeated names like final1.psd , final22.psd so he/she can recognize which version he is working with.
- We will try to make our structure in Version Control or will take the gnu structure of Git and try to enahnce it to be applicable with Design Programs not only files
- We will also try to make a desktop application to make the (git proccess with GUI Tool for non-developers) and also a Front-End also like github.com
- This idea can also serve another people like: Architects, 3D Animators, Video Editors and many others.
